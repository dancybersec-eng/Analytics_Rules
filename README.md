# ðŸ§  Detection-as-Code (KQL + YAML)

A collection of **Threat Detection-as-Code rules** written in **KQL** and defined using **YAML metadata** for version control, automation, and collaboration.  
This repository follows modern detection engineering principles â€” focusing on **repeatability, transparency, and scalability** for enterprise Threat Detection & Response.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project provides reusable detection content for:
- **Microsoft Sentinel** (KQL-based detections)
- **DetectionFlow-style CI/CD pipelines**
- **Sigma-inspired YAML rule structure**
- **Security data lake or SIEM automation**

Each detection is written in **KQL** and wrapped in a **YAML file** containing metadata, log sources, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and query logic.
